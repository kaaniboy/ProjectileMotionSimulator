# Projectile Motion Simulator
### Kaan Aksoy | PHY 121 (Dr. Easson) Honors Contract

This is a projectile motion simulator developed in Java as an Honors Contract for the PHY 121 course taught by Dr. Easson.

__The simulator has the following functionality:__
1. Accepts inputs for initial height, initial angle, and initial velocity of the projectile.
2. Displays an animated simulation of the projectile as it flies through the air.
3. Labels significant points in the projectile's motion (ie, its highest point).
4. Provides information about the results of the simulation:
   * Total air time.
   * Total distance traveled.
   * Maximum height of the projectile.
